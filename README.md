# Image Segmentation Using U-Net With Different Bottlenecks

This project focuses on performing image segmentation using the U-Net architecture with different bottleneck variations. The U-Net model is widely used in computer vision tasks, particularly for semantic segmentation, due to its ability to capture fine-grained details while maintaining contextual information. By exploring different bottleneck configurations, the project aims to improve the segmentation performance and adapt the model to specific application requirements.

## Description

The Image Segmentation Using U-Net With Different Bottlenecks project aims to leverage the U-Net architecture to perform image segmentation tasks. Image segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple regions or segments to identify and classify different objects or areas within the image. The U-Net model, known for its encoder-decoder structure and skip connections, has proven effective in various segmentation tasks.

This project focuses on exploring different bottleneck variations within the U-Net model. The bottleneck refers to the middle layer(s) of the U-Net architecture, where the representation of the input is compressed before being expanded back to the original image dimensions. By modifying the bottleneck configuration, such as changing the number of layers, incorporating residual connections, or using different convolutional block types, the project aims to improve the model's segmentation accuracy, speed, or memory efficiency.

The project provides multiple implementations of the U-Net model with different bottleneck variations. Each implementation is available as a separate script, allowing users to easily experiment with different configurations and compare their performance.
